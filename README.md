# ImageRestoration
Image Deburring and Denoising:

This work is to develop the software-based correction algorithm for blurry and noisy image reconstrucion. 

1. Image model: (blurring/convolution kernel)
2. Physics statistical model: Gaussian model, Poisson model, etc.
3. Cost function: log-likelihood and prior(regularization term: TV-L1/L2, Non-local TV-L1/L2, etc.)
4. Iterative algorithm for reconstruction: e.g. Gradient Descent, Variational Approach.
